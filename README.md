This project is a simple GitHub Profile Analyzer built using Python and Flask.

It takes a GitHub username as input and fetches public data from the GitHub API.
The application analyzes the user’s repositories and returns useful information
such as total repositories, stars, forks, programming languages used, and the most
starred repository.

The project works as a REST API and returns results.
It does not use any frontend, HTML, or CSS.

This project is useful for learning Flask, REST APIs, and working with third-party APIs.
It can also be used for basic GitHub profile screening.
